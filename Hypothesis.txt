Hypothesis:
We can understand the mental health conditions and/or the correlation between the mental and
physical health of the users from smartphone app usage metadata.
Current Plan:
1. To do analytics on the existing dataset for establishing the proposed hypothesis and
developing a model. → explore the dataset, find out the existing features and ground
truths → self-supervised or unsupervised kind of learning can be incorporated.
2. Design and develop the app as we will be launching a social study to collect the data.
Existing codebase can be utilized. The target parameters and automated & non-invasive
ground truth generation procedure will be discussed in the next meeting. Think over it as
well.
