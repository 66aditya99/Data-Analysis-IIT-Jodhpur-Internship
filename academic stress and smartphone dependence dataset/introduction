Linear regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship among the variables. The results showed that academic stress was positively related to psychological distress, which may further lead to severe smartphone dependence. Psychological distress partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and smartphone dependence. The mediating effect of psychological distress between academic stress and smartphone dependence was moderated by academic resilience. Specifically, academic resilience weakened the indirect relationship between academic stress and smartphone dependence that was mediated by psychological distress.
